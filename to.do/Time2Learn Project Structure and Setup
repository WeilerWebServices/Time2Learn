# Time2Learn Project Structure and Setup

Creating an advanced educational app(Time2Learn) that dynamically generates questions from Dolch sight word lists while also including multimedia assets, adaptive learning features, and detailed progress tracking is an ambitious and rewarding project. Below is a high-level outline of how to build such an app using Python, along with the necessary code to get started.

Given the complexity of the project, it is essential to have a well-organized structure. Here’s a proposed structure:

Time2Learn/
│
├── src/
│   ├── main.py                  # Entry point for the application
│   ├── db.py                    # Database management for words, questions, and progress
│   ├── lesson_manager.py        # Manages lesson generation and algorithms
│   ├── utils.py                 # Utility functions (random generation, shuffling, etc.)
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── images/              # Directory for all image assets
│   │   ├── audio/               # Directory for all audio files
│   │   ├── videos/              # Directory for videos (if applicable)
│   │   ├── symbols/             # Directory for symbols, numbers, clocks, etc.
│   │   └── other/               # Miscellaneous assets (letters, colors, etc.)
│   └── lessons/
│       ├── dolch_pre_k.py       # Lesson generator for Pre-K Dolch sight words
│       ├── dolch_k.py           # Lesson generator for Kindergarten Dolch sight words
│       ├── dolch_first_grade.py # Lesson generator for First Grade Dolch sight words
│       ├── dolch_second_grade.py# Lesson generator for Second Grade Dolch sight words
│       └── dolch_third_grade.py # Lesson generator for Third Grade Dolch sight words
