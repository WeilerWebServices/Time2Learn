Simple Quiz Maker V0.60 July 2020

Help file
---------------------------------
What you need to create your own stand alone quiz program:

A name for your quiz.

files:
A logo image.
A text file of questions.
A text file of the multiple choice answers.
(Optional images for questions)

Just show Simple Quiz Maker where these files are and
it will do the rest for you.

Ths version supports background music and image questions,
see end of this text for more details. 

-------------------------------------------------------
If you look in the "example quiz files" folder you will
find an example of these files that I made for my 
Bottom Quiz. Try a test run using these files so you can
get an idea of how SQM works.
---------------------------------------------------------


Creating A logo image
----------------------
Use graphics editing software like Photoshop Elements, or 
any graphic editing software that allows you to
Load in your image and place any text you want on it.

You can find free photos and images at pixabay.com.

Then apply the name of your quiz onto the image.
Example, "The Python Programming Quiz, By Geoff McBulgy".

The image should be 450 pixels wide by 253 pixels high,
although it will be resized by SQM when you load it in
anyway so don't worry if you don't know how to do that.
(although it could lose its shape in some cases if you 
do not do it yourself.) Also if the image is close to 450x253
SQM will resize usually with no loss of shape.

You can save your logo image in most formats, including:
.jpg, bmp. png, etc.


In SQM in step 2 (see later for more detail on this),
choose the image file you created and it will be 
displayed as you will see it in your finished quiz.


Creating a questions File:
--------------------------
This is just a standard text file that you can create
in notepad, or a similar app.

* Each question must be on one line only.
* No blank lines allowed.
* Maximum line length is about 80 characters.
* The file must be named and saved as "questions.txt".

Example:
What year was the battle of Hastings?
What is two score and ten?
How long did queen Victoria reign?
What year did the Titanic sink?

Save your questions to a file called "questions.txt"


Creating your answers File:
----------------------------
Again, a simple text file created in Notepad.

********************IMPORTANT*************************
For this version of SQM you will need to have 
FOUR BLANK LINES at the very start of the answers file.
******************************************************

Each question must have four possible answers in this file, 
laid out in the same order as the questions.

Each answer must have a line of its own. 
You should use a maximum of about 50 characters per line.

Be sure to make the first answer of the four choices 
the correct answer as the program looks for that to 
know what the correct answer is.

If any of the above rules are broken the quiz will 
not work properly, get answers wrong or maybe crash.

Example, (linked to above example questions)
Note the 4 blank lines to start with:
----------------------------------------------




1066
1166
966
866
30
40
50
60
64 years
54 years
34 years
24 years
1912
1812
2012
1712

Remember that the first answer of the four MUST be the correct
answer otherwise the program may get the answer wrong.

Don't worry, the answer choices will be randomly  mixed
up each time the quiz is run.

Save your answers to a text file called "answers.txt"

So, the answers were, 1066,30,64 years,1912.

Now that you have your files ready,
run Simple Quiz Maker and follow each step.

Step 1: Name your quiz.
------------------------
In the entry box delete the words "Your quiz name" and
replace with the name of your quiz, examples:

A General Knowledge quiz
Python V3 Programmers Quiz 2019
Telegraph poles of the 19th Century
The table of elements quiz. By Greg

The maximum characters you can use in the title is 39,
if you use more it will be cut off.

When you are ready click the step 1 button to commit.

A folder will now be created in the current directory
using your quiz name. Your quiz name will also be displayed
in the window bar of your finished quiz and used to name the 
executable file that runs your quiz.

Step 2: Load your logo image.
----------------------------
Click on the step 2 button, this will pop up a file selector
for you to choose the image that you created earlier.

If the image is not 450x253 pixels it will be resized and
hopefully will not lose its shape. If it looks odd then
you will have re-edit it if you can.

Your logo will now be displayed in the exact
way it will look in your finished quiz game.

You can try out as many different images here as you want.

When you are happy with your logo, 
click the button below the logo,
"Click here to use this image"
to commit the image, and move on to step 3.

Step 3: Loading your questions and answers files.
--------------------------------------------------
Click on the "..." button to the right of 
the "your questions file" input box.

A file selector will pop up and you should be careful
to choose the correct file that you created earlier called  "questions.txt".

Now do the same for the answers.txt file using the
second "..." button.

Finishing up:
-------------
Once you have completed all three steps click on "save" 
to save all the settings to your quiz folder.

Test Quiz:
----------
Now give your quiz a trial run to see if it looks and works 
as you had hoped by clicking on "Test",
Just in case you didn't save settings first 
SQM will do that for you now regardless.

View Your quiz folder:
----------------------
All the files that you need to run your quiz on its own 
can be found in a single folder with the name of your quiz, 
click on: 
"View" to see that folders contents.

Your quiz program is now a standalone portable program, 
as long as all the files remain together in the folder.

You can copy that folder anywhere and run 
yourquizname.exe
and your quiz will happily run from anywhere.

Making a picture quiz:
----------------------
If you want an image to be shown with a question
then simply add a png file with the question number
into your quiz folder.

Example, if you want a picture to to be displayed for
question 1 then save the desired image as "1.png".
Again if you want a pic for question 5, 5.png
and so on.

You can have a picture for every question, some questions,
or no questions at all.

If no picture is linked to a question then your logo image
will be used instead.

Adding some background music:
-----------------------------
Simply find an mp3 of some music you like, 
rename it sqm.mp3 and copy to your quiz folder.
This will be automatically played on loop
throughout the game.
The music vcan be stopped or restarted from 
the drop-down menu.
